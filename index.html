    <h1>What's Wrong With Trials of Osiris?</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Current matchmaking making it very difficult for average players to make any progress towards loot</li>
        <li>Lack of flawless loot, thus less of an incentive to go flawless</li>
        <li>Cheaters...cheaters everywhere</li>
    </ul>
